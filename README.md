## Structure Details

### 01-introduction
**Files:** `overview.md`, `architecture.md`  
- **overview.md**: General introduction to Airflow, its purpose, and use cases in ETL and workflow orchestration.  
- **architecture.md**: Detailed explanation of Airflow architecture including Scheduler, Webserver, Metadata Database, and Executor concepts.

### 02-core-components
**Files:** `operators.md`, `sensors.md`, `hooks.md`  
- **operators.md**: Core building blocks of workflows, including PythonOperator, BashOperator, and custom operators.  
- **sensors.md**: Overview of sensors and how they are used to wait for certain conditions or external events.  
- **hooks.md**: Connectors to external systems such as databases, APIs, and cloud services.

### 03-ecosystem
**Files:** `integrations.md`, `providers.md`, `plugins.md`, `community.md`  
- **integrations.md**: How Airflow integrates with data warehouses, ETL tools, and orchestration systems.  
- **providers.md**: Explanation of provider packages (e.g., Google, AWS, Azure) and how they extend functionality.  
- **plugins.md**: Custom plugins, operators, sensors, hooks, and UI extensions.  
- **community.md**: Overview of Airflow community, forums, and contribution guidelines.

### 04-logging-monitoring
**Files:** `logging.md`, `monitoring.md`  
- **logging.md**: How Airflow logs task execution, DAG runs, and system events.  
- **monitoring.md**: Monitoring workflows using Airflow UI, alerts, and metrics with external tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

### 05-version-differences
**Files:** `airflow-2.md`, `airflow-3.md`  
- **airflow-2.md**: Key differences and improvements from Airflow 1.x to 2.x.  
- **airflow-3.md**: Expected updates and changes in Airflow 3.x (if available), focusing on architecture, scheduling, and API changes.

### references.md
- A curated list of books, articles, official documentation, and tutorials for deeper learning.

## Notes
- This repository **only covers theoretical knowledge**. Hands-on ETL projects using Airflow will be in separate repositories.  
- Airflow is part of a broader **data orchestration ecosystem**, connecting with tools like DBT, Apache Spark, Kafka, and more.  
- The repository is designed to **help beginners and intermediate users** understand Airflow’s core concepts before implementing real pipelines.
