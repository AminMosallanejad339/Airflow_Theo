# Introduction to Apache Airflow

## What is Apache Airflow?

Apache Airflow is an open-source platform designed to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. It allows you to orchestrate complex data pipelines and automate tasks in a reliable and scalable manner. Created by Maxime Beauchemin at Airbnb in 2014 and later donated to the Apache Software Foundation, Airflow has become the industry standard for workflow orchestration.

Airflow is widely used in data engineering, machine learning pipelines, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, and any scenario where workflows need automation.

## Key Features

1. **Dynamic Workflows**  
   - Workflows in Airflow are defined using Python code, which allows dynamic generation of tasks and dependencies.

2. **Extensible**  
   - Airflow provides hooks, operators, and executors that allow integration with different systems like databases, cloud services, and APIs.

3. **Scalable**  
   - Supports distributed execution using Celery, Kubernetes, or other executors to scale workflows across multiple machines.

4. **Monitoring & Logging**  
   - Airflow provides a rich web UI to visualize pipelines, monitor task execution, and view logs for debugging.

5. **Scheduling**  
   - Workflows can be scheduled using CRON-like expressions or predefined intervals.

## Core Concepts

### 1. DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)

- **Definition**: A collection of tasks with directional dependencies

- **Characteristics**: No cycles allowed (tasks can't depend on themselves)

- **Purpose**: Defines how tasks should run and their relationships

  A DAG is the central concept in Airflow. It represents a workflow as a directed graph where:

  - Nodes = Tasks
  - Edges = Dependencies between tasks
  - DAGs are **acyclic**, meaning tasks cannot form loops.

  Example DAG structure:

  Task A --> Task B --> Task C

### 2. Operators

- **Definition**: Building blocks that define what actually gets done

- **Types**:

  - **Action Operators**: Execute tasks (e.g., PythonOperator, BashOperator)

  - **Transfer Operators**: Move data between systems

  - **Sensor Operators**: Wait for something to happen

    ### Operator

    Operators define **what** gets done in a task. Common types:

    - **PythonOperator** – Run Python functions

    - **BashOperator** – Execute Bash commands

    - **EmailOperator** – Send emails

    - **DummyOperator** – Placeholder task

    - **BranchPythonOperator** – Conditional branching

      ### Sensor

      Sensors are special operators that **wait for a condition** to be met before running downstream tasks (e.g., waiting for a file to exist).

      ### Executor

      Executors handle **how tasks are run**. Some popular executors:

      - **SequentialExecutor** – Single-threaded (for testing)
      - **LocalExecutor** – Multi-threaded on a single machine
      - **CeleryExecutor** – Distributed execution
      - **KubernetesExecutor** – Run tasks in Kubernetes pods

### 3. Tasks

- **Definition**: Instances of operators that represent individual units of work
- **Execution**: Each task runs independently on potentially different workers
- A **task** represents a single unit of work in a DAG. Airflow executes tasks using **operators**.

### 4. Task Instances

- **Definition**: Specific runs of a task with a defined execution date and state
- **States**: running, success, failed, skipped, up_for_retry, etc.

### 5. Scheduler

- **Role**: Parses DAGs, checks schedules, and triggers task instances
- **Function**: The brain of Airflow that orchestrates everything

### 6. Executor

- **Role**: Handles how tasks are actually executed
- **Types**: LocalExecutor, CeleryExecutor, KubernetesExecutor, etc.

### 7. Web Server

- **Role**: Provides the UI for monitoring and managing DAGs and tasks

## Installation

Airflow can be installed using `pip`:

```bash
pip install apache-airflow
```

After installation, initialize the database:

```bash
airflow db init
```

Start the webserver:

```bash
airflow webserver --port 8080
```

Start the scheduler:

```bash
airflow scheduler
```

Access the web UI at: `http://localhost:8080`

## Airflow Use Cases

1. **ETL Pipelines**
   - Extract data from multiple sources, transform it, and load it into a data warehouse.
2. **Machine Learning Pipelines**
   - Automate feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
3. **Data Quality Checks**
   - Automate validation and alerting if data does not meet quality standards.
4. **API Automation**
   - Schedule regular API calls and process responses automatically.
